## Part 1: Most Popular Baby Names in the 20th Century (USA)

**Objective:**  
Using the `babynames` dataset, I identified the three most popular male baby names in the United States during the 20th century (1900-1999). The tasks involved:

- Loading the `babynames` tibble.
- Filtering data for male babies born between 1900 and 1999.
- Using `dplyr` to summarize and find the top three names by total count.
- Creating a `ggplot2` line graph to show how the popularity of these names changed over the century.

**Deliverable:**  
A one-page R script with well-commented code and a graph illustrating name popularity trends.
