# R-Programming-Assessment
This repository contains my solutions for an R programming assessment focusing on data manipulation, exploration, and visualization using the tidyverse package suite.

Part 1: Most Popular Baby Names in the 20th Century (USA)
Objective:
Using the babynames dataset, I identified the three most popular male baby names in the United States during the 20th century (1900-1999). The task involved:

Loading the babynames tibble.

Filtering the data for male babies born between 1900 and 1999.

Using dplyr to summarize and find the top three names by total count.

Creating a ggplot2 line graph to show the popularity trends of these names over the century.

Deliverable:
A one-page R script with well-commented code and a graph illustrating the name trends.

Part 2: Data Exploration of Amazon Kindle Books Dataset (2023)
Dataset:
The dataset includes 130,000+ records of Amazon Kindle Books, with attributes such as book title, authors, ratings, pricing, and sales metrics. It was sourced from Kaggle:

Amazon Kindle Books Dataset 2023 - Kaggle

Objective:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into the e-book market, aiding business decision-making or marketing strategy development.

Technologies and Packages Used
R language

tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2, etc.)

babynames package (for Part 1)

How to Run
Open the provided R script files in RStudio or your preferred R environment.

Make sure the required packages are installed (tidyverse, babynames).

Run the script to reproduce the analysis and visualize the graphs.

Notes
Each script contains comments explaining the purpose of each line/block.

The graph visualizes temporal trends clearly to highlight changes over time.
